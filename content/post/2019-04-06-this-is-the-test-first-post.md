After reading a million Blog posts and Articles on Fashion and Beauty, I can't believe I'm writing my very first post!!!!!!

# WHO AM I?

Hey guys, I'm **Priya**, a 21-year-old simple and candid girl, attracted and absorbed to anything and everything **FASHION**. 

**Blogging** was something I've wanted to do since forever , but always had the _"ifs"_ and _"buts"_, in my mind. As they say "It's always the right time do what you want". So, finally, I went ahead and started my very own blog.

# WHY AM I BLOGGING?

I've always been a person with an opinion on specific trends, fashion, beauty products, make up and what not. It's safe to say that, from reading a gazillion magazines like Vogue and Cosmopolitan, always lurking around Fashion related pages on Instagram.
I do have a fair knowledge about everything that is **HOT** and in style right now. Blogging, therefore is the perfect platform to put myself out there, connect with people who share my interests, and hopefully even ignite my interests into new people.

# WHAT WILL I FIND IN THIS PAGE?

**_The Aesthetic Arien Girl_** is going to be occupy a lot of articles related to Fashion, Beauty Lifestyle and DIY's.

## FASHION AND BEAUTY

> _Life is a party; So dress like it_

I would describe my personal style as **Chic** and **Grungy**. **_The Aesthetic Arien Girl_** will contain articles on experimental, affordable, everyday Fashion. I believe in an individual's personal fashion and style, ranging from clothes to shoes and accessories, speaks heaps about a person. **_The Aesthetic Arien Girl_**  is going to help you identify what your personal style is, what might work great for your body type, wardrobe basics, do's and don't s, and the list goes on and on...

## BEAUTY AND LIFESTYLE

> _Fall in love with taking care of yourself; mind, body and spirit_

Giving attention and pampering one's self  is very essential to enhance self-esteem, and put yourself out there as the best version of yourself. **_The Aesthetic Arien Girl_** includes various beauty regime reviews on various trending beauty products, homemade masks and healthy recipes. I believe I live an Aesthetic lifestyle, and will share my insight through **_The Aesthetic Arien Girl_**.

_**The Aesthetic Arien Girl**_ will have heaps of content, for both women and men, who're conscious about their style, what they put into their body, or people who keep wondering how to get those prominent pimple out of their faces and have a clear radiant skin. I do hope to God, that one day, **_The Aesthetic Arien Girl_** would turn into a Brand.

Blogging is something that I absolutely love, and will put my heart and soul into giving you guys the best content. I would like to thank my whole family, for encouraging me to believe in myself and pushing me to do what I do best. I'm also grateful to all my friends who believed I could do this. A big thank vou to **Shuraim**, who created this wonderful page, and made it better than I could have ever imagined. Lastly, always, and I mean always _**"LOVE YOURSELF"**_, because I believe **YOU** are the only person, who can ever give yourself everything **YOU** ever want.
